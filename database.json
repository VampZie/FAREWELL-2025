            "poem": "In the quiet lab, where dreams would weave,\nTwo hearts met, on a golden eve.\nThrough pages turned and data traced,\nLove found light in that sacred space.\nHer head would rest upon my chest,\nA fleeting touch, a moment blessed.\nFingers brushed, a whispered sigh,\nTime stood still as love passed by.\nYet when the echoes of footsteps came,\nShe’d pull away, her cheeks aflame.\nA stolen glance, a secret smile,\nLove unspoken, yet known all the while.\nThough fate may drift like waves to shore,\nSome memories last forevermore.\nIn that last semester’s fleeting hue,\nShe was my love—soft, yet true."
