            "poem": "In the quiet lab, where dreams would weave,\nTwo hearts met, on a golden eve.\nThrough pages turned and data traced,\nLove found light in that sacred space.\nHer head would rest upon my chest,\nA fleeting touch, a moment blessed.\nFingers brushed, a whispered sigh,\nTime stood still as love passed by.\nYet when the echoes of footsteps came,\nShe’d pull away, her cheeks aflame.\nA stolen glance, a secret smile,\nLove unspoken, yet known all the while.\nThough fate may drift like waves to shore,\nSome memories last forevermore.\nIn that last semester’s fleeting hue,\nShe was my love—soft, yet true."

            "poem": "The screen once held me, night and day,\nIn pixel worlds, I'd lose my way.\nQuests and battles filled my mind,\nYet real-life joys were left behind.\n\nThe ticking clock, I paid no heed,\nChasing scores with endless need.\nFriends grew distant, dreams stood still,\nTrapped within the gaming thrill.\n\nThen one day, I broke the chain,\nStepped outside in sun and rain.\nThe world was vast, so much to see,\nA life beyond the games—just me.\n\nNo longer lost in endless play,\nI found my path, a brighter day.\nNow I live where moments last,\nNot in a screen, but in my past."

            "poem": "Felt a little weak, just a slight unease,\nBrushed it off like a passing breeze.\nBut yellow eyes stared back at me,\nA warning sign I failed to see.\n\nFatigue took over, meals felt bland,\nEvery sip of water tasted like sand.\nDoctor’s words hit like a heavy blow,\nJaundice—nowhere else to go.\n\nDays in bed, light too bright,\nNausea creeping in every night.\nNo more junk, no more fun,\nJust rest and meds till the battle’s won.\n\nLesson learned, health comes first,\nIgnoring signs makes things worse.\nSlowly healed, but I now feel,\nJaundice hit hard—shit got real."
