Her head would rest upon my chest, A fleeting touch, a moment blessed. Fingers brushed, a whispered sigh, Time stood still as love passed by. Yet when the echoes of footsteps came, She’d pull away, her cheeks aflame. A stolen glance, a secret smile, Love unspoken, yet known all the while. Though fate may drift like waves to shore, Some memories last forevermore. In that last semester’s fleeting hue, She was my love—soft, yet true."
